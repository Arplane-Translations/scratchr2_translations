    "faq.multipleLoginTitle":"E' permesso che più persone accedano al sito di Scratch usando uno stesso account?",
    "faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the <a href=\"/community_guidelines\">Community Guidelines</a>, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.",
    "faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Posso cambiare il mio username?",
    "faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username.
