    "faq.biggerBlocksScratch3Body":"In order to make Scratch 3.0 work well on touch devices (like many Chromebooks, Windows Surface laptops, and tablets), we needed to make the blocks bigger, so that it’s easier to drag and tap the blocks.

    "faq.creativeCommonsTitle":"E se eu não quiser que outras pessoas façam remixagens de meus projetos?",

    "faq.whyAccountTitle":"Why is it useful to have a Scratch account?",
    "faq.whyAccountBody":"Even without an account, you can play other people’s projects, read comments and forums, and even create your own projects. But you need an account to save and share projects, write comments and forum posts, and participate in other \"social\" activities in the community (like \"loving\" other people’s projects).",
    "faq.createAccountTitle":"How can I create an account?",
    "faq.createAccountBody":"Just click <i>Join</i> on the Scratch home page. You’ll need to respond to a few questions, and provide an email address. It takes just a couple minutes, and it’s totally free!",

If you cannot find the email with the confirmation link, check your Spam folder. If you still can’t find it, and want to receive another copy, go to your Account Settings, click the Email tab, and follow the instructions there. Please note that it may take up to an hour for the email to arrive. If you still don't see the email after an hour, <a href=\"/contact-us\">let us know</a>.",

    "faq.multipleAccountBody":"It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the <a href=\"/community_guidelines\">Community Guidelines</a>. In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.",
    "faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Posso ter mais de uma pessoa conectada em uma mesma conta?",
    "faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the <a href=\"/community_guidelines\">Community Guidelines</a>, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.",
    "faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Posso mudar meu nome de usuário?",
    "faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username.

    "faq.shareInfoTitle":"Quais informações posso compartilhar em minha conta?",
    "faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website.
