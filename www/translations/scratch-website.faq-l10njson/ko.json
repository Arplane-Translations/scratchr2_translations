    "faq.remixableBody":"We believe that remixing other people’s projects is a great way to learn to program and to create interesting projects. Through remixing, creative ideas spread through the Scratch community, and everyone benefits.

    "faq.multipleLoginTitle":"한 계정에 한 명보다 많은 사람이 로그인하도록 해도 괜찮나요?",
    "faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the <a href=\"/community_guidelines\">Community Guidelines</a>, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.",
    "faq.changeUsernameTitle":"사용자 이름을 변경할 수 있나요?",
    "faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username.
