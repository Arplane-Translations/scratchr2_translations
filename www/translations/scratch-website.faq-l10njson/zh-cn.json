    "faq.biggerBlocksScratch3Body":"In order to make Scratch 3.0 work well on touch devices (like many Chromebooks, Windows Surface laptops, and tablets), we needed to make the blocks bigger, so that it’s easier to drag and tap the blocks. In addition, blocks are slightly bigger in Scratch 3.0 to help address issues we observed with new users having trouble clicking and dragging small interface elements.",

    "faq.multipleLoginTitle":"一个帐号可以允许多个人同时登录吗?",
    "faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the <a href=\"/community_guidelines\">Community Guidelines</a>, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.

    "faq.changeUsernameTitle":"可以改变用户名吗？",
    "faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username.
