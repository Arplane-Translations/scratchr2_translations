    "faq.creativeCommonsTitle":"Què passa si no vull que els altres reinventin els meus projectes?",

    "faq.createAccountTitle":"How can I create an account?",
    "faq.createAccountBody":"Just click <i>Join</i> on the Scratch home page. You’ll need to respond to a few questions, and provide an email address. It takes just a couple minutes, and it’s totally free!",

Once you confirm your account, you’ll be able to share projects, write comments, and create studios. Confirming your account also lets you receive email updates from the Scratch Team. If you cannot find the email with the confirmation link, check your Spam folder. If you still can’t find it, and want to receive another copy, go to your Account Settings, click the Email tab, and follow the instructions there.

    "faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Està bé que més d'una persona iniciï la sessió amb un mateix compte?",
    "faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the <a href=\"/community_guidelines\">Community Guidelines</a>, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.",
    "faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Puc canviar el meu nom d'usuari?",
    "faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username.
