  "developers.faqTitle": "Häufig gestellte Fragen",
  "developers.projectsIntro": "The following projects are open source and available for any purpose.",
  "developers.scratchBlocksTitle": "Scratch Blöcke",
  "developers.scratchBlocksIntro": "Scratch Blocks is a new development project for the next generation of graphical programming blocks, based on a collaboration between Google and MIT’s Scratch Team — building on Google’s <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/blockly/\">Blockly technology</a> and informed by the Scratch Team’s expertise in developing creative learning tools for young people. Scratch Blocks will provide a framework for building programming blocks in both vertical (text-based) and horizontal (icon-based) formats. You can access the code (currently as a developer-preview) and documentation <a href=\"https://github.com/llk/scratch-blocks\">here</a>.",
  "developers.scratchBlocksBody": "This first release includes code for Scratch’s Horizontal Grammar. Looking ahead, we plan to release additional code including but not limited to the Vertical Grammar (currently used by Scratch), a new Rendering Engine to support sprites and graphic effects, and a new Audio Engine to support creation with sound and music.",
  "developers.wwwTitle": "Scratch-Wiki",
  "developers.wwwIntro": "Scratch-www is a standalone web client for the Scratch Community, built using React and Redux. Access the code and documentation <a href=\"https://github.com/LLK/scratch-www\">here</a>.",
  "developers.principlesIntro": "We created Scratch to empower young people to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively. We are guided by a set of <b>Learning Principles</b> and <b>Design Principles</b> that we hope you will follow as you develop new tools and technologies with Scratch Blocks.",
  "developers.learningPrinciplesTitle": "Lernprinzipien",
  "developers.learningPrinciplesProjectsBody": "People learn best when they are actively working on projects — generating new ideas, designing prototypes, making improvements and creating final products.",
  "developers.learningPrinciplesPassionTitle": "Leidenschaft",
  "developers.learningPrinciplesPassionBody": "When people focus on things they care about, they work longer and harder, persist in the face of challenges, and learn more in the process.",
  "developers.learningPrinciplesPeersTitle": "Peers",
  "developers.learningPrinciplesPeersBody": "Learning flourishes as a social activity, with people sharing ideas, collaborating on projects, and building on one another's work.",
  "developers.learningPrinciplesPlayTitle": "Spielen",
  "developers.learningPrinciplesPlayBody": "Lernen beinhaltet das spielerische Experimentieren — neue Dinge ausprobieren, mit Materialien herumspielen, Grenzen austesten, Risiken eingehen, immer und immer wiederholen.",
  "developers.designPrinciplesTitle": "Designprinzipien",
  "developers.designPrinciplesRoomTitle": "Low Floor & Wide Walls",
  "developers.designPrinciplesRoomBody": "In order to encourage a varied and diverse set of interactions, we explicitly include elements and features that are easy for kids to understand (low floor), but general enough to support diverse uses (wide walls).",
  "developers.designPrinciplesSimpleTitle": "Make it as Simple as Possible — And Maybe Even Simpler",
  "developers.designPrinciplesSimpleBody": "Despite the common drive to add more features to software products, we have found that reducing the number of features often improves the user experience. What initially seems like a constraint or limitation can foster new forms of creativity.",
  "developers.designPrinciplesGlobalTitle": "Viele Pfade, viele Stile",
  "developers.designPrinciplesGlobalBody": "Many math and science activities have traditionally been biased towards specific populations. By paying special attention to creating accessible and appealing technologies, we are working to close the gap.",
  "developers.designPrinciplesTinkerTitle": "Design for Tinkerability",
  "developers.designPrinciplesTinkerBody": "We believe that the learning process is inherently iterative. Tinkerers start by exploring and experimenting, then revising and refining their goals and creations. To support this style of interaction, we design our interfaces to encourage quick experimentation and rapid cycles of iteration.",
  "developers.joinBody": "We're a diverse group of educators, designers, and engineers, who work together in a playful, creative environment full of LEGO bricks, craft materials, and maker tools. We strongly value diversity, collaboration, and respect in the workplace. If you're interested in joining us, take a look at our open positions on our <a href=\"/jobs\">Jobs Page</a>, or send us an email at <a href=\"mailto:jobs+developers@scratch.mit.edu\">jobs+developers@scratch.mit.edu</a>.",
  "developers.donateIntro": "We are pleased to provide Scratch free of charge. If you enjoy using Scratch, please consider <a href=\"https://secure.donationpay.org/scratchfoundation/\">making a donation to support Scratch</a>. Donations of any size are appreciated.",
  "developers.donateBody": "Ihre Spende an die Scratch-Stiftung wird dazu genutzt um die Weiterentwicklung der Scratch Software sowie der Scratch-Webseite zu unterstützen. ",
  "developers.donateThanks": "Danke für den Beitritt zu Scratch!",
  "developers.partnersIntro": "The creation and maintenance of this open source code would not be possible without generous technical and financial support from our partners:",
  "developers.faqAboutTitle": "Wo kann ich mehr über Scratch erfahren?",
  "developers.faqAboutBody": "Scratch ist eine freie Programmiersprache und gleichzeitig eine Online-Gemeinschaft, die es dir ermöglicht, interaktive Geschichten, Spiele und Animationen zu erstellen. Scratch ist ein Projekt der Gruppe <a href=\"https://llk.media.mit.edu/\">Lifelong Kindergarten</a> am <a href=\"http://media.mit.edu/\">MIT Media-Lab</a>. <a href=\"/about\">Hier</a> kannst Du mehr über Scratch erfahren.",
  "developers.faqRulesTitle": "Are there rules to using this code in my application?",
  "developers.faqRulesBody": "You may use this code in accordance with the license which governs each project. We also strongly encourage you to consider the learning and design principles (above, on this page) when building creative learning experiences for kids of all ages.",
  "developers.faqNameTitle": "Am I allowed to use the name \"Scratch Blocks\" in the description of my app and other public messaging?",
  "developers.faqNameBody": "If you wish, you can publicly state that your application is powered by Scratch Blocks. If you do so, we would also encourage you to link back to the code repository.",
  "developers.faqReleasesTitle": "Veröfentlichen Sie mehr Kode und wenn ja, wann?",
  "developers.faqReleasesBody": "We plan to open source additional code relating to the Scratch programming language over the next few months. Keep an eye on this page!",
  "developers.faqDifferencesTitle": "Was ist der Unterschied zwischen Blockly und Scratch-Blöcken?",
  "developers.faqDifferencesBody": "Scratch Blocks builds upon the Blockly code base, and is specifically designed with our principles in mind to support creative learning experiences.",
  "developers.faqCollabTitle": "Ich würde gerne mitarbeiten. Wie kann ich mit Ihnen in Verbindung treten?",
  "developers.faqCollabBody": "Sie können uns über <a href=\"https://github.com/LLK/\">Github</a> erreichen oder Sie senden eine E-Mail an <a href=\"mailto:help@scratch.mit.edu\">help@scratch.mit.edu.</a> Wir freuen uns von Ihnen zu hören!"
